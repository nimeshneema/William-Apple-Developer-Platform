## Help building mental model of SwiftUI

I've worked through most of the SwiftUI tutorials at developer.apple.com, but don't have a good understanding of how the pieces go together or why what I typed works. I would like to be able to build a better mental model of SwiftUI and have a better understanding of the syntax so that I can work independently.

Understanding intricacies and quirks and establish a solid grounding in the fundamentals to be able to build on top of it.
