# Timeline

List of items to study, learning sequence and tentative completion timelines.

-   Formally diving deeper into functions in Swift language.

    -   Externalised parameter names (forms a part of the name of function)

    -   What goes into Functions in Swift, Various ways of passing parameters, returning multiple values, anonymous functions, closures and abbreviated function syntax (which is extensively used in SwiftUI).

-   "Functions", Closures, Anonymous functions, Functions acting as first class citizen.

    Once we cover the above items, it will give a rock solid foundation (not pun intended) in understanding most of all what happens in both Swift and SwiftUI. Both of them utilise concepts from here heavily.

    -   Functions are very very pervasive in Swift. While functions are a crucial part of any programming environment, Swift leverages them to the next level. Swift language makes extensive use of some advance concepts in functions. (When I say functions, I am talking about functions in programming languages in general)

        As the programming evolved over the last decades a lot of advance concepts around functions were developed (such as functions being first class citizen, closures, lambda).

        Swift language makes extensive use of advance concepts in functions which help provide us with pretty powerful thought tooling when it comes to writing code.

    -   We will focus on understanding functions (starting with understanding them in general (agnostic to any programming language))

## Swift Programming Language - Topics to Learn

-   Functions.

-   Optionals (Swift language feature, very critical and pervasive. Enables seamless communication with Objective-C entities and objects).

-   Applied object oriented programming concepts (Conceptual clarity).

    -   Message sending and invoking methods.

    -   We send a message to an instance (of a class) and the instance upon receiving the message executes a method in response.

-   Object types in Swift (Classes/Structs/Enum, their features and initialisers). Swift langauge has some advance, interesting and unique features.

-   Umbrella Types (Any, AnyObject)

-   control structures (loops and conditionals). Related advance features in Swift.

-   Asynchronous programming (Interesting, advance and pervasive)

-   Scope and Namespace in Swift.

-   Static Analysis.
