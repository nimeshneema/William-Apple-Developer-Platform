# Timeline

List of items to study, along with learning sequence and tentative completion timelines.

-   Programming is twofold activity:

    -   Thinking + Designing (True programming)

    -   Coding (Manifestation).

-   The trinity of coding:

    A very very simple yet very powerful mental model. This will change how you do and view coding forever.

    -   Sequence.

    -   Selection.

    -   Iteration.

-   Parts of a function:

    -   Name (the primary interface)

    -   Argument list and their (data) types.

    -   Return (data) type.

    -   Body.

-   Formally diving deeper into functions in Swift language.

    -   Externalised parameter names (forms a part of the name of function)

    -   What goes into Functions in Swift, Various ways of passing parameters, returning multiple values, anonymous functions, closures and abbreviated function syntax (which is extensively used in SwiftUI).

-   "Functions", Closures, Anonymous functions, Functions acting as first class citizen.

    Once we cover the above items, it will give a rock solid foundation (not pun intended) in understanding most of all what happens in both Swift and SwiftUI. Both of them utilise concepts from here heavily.

    -   Functions are very very pervasive in Swift. While functions are a crucial part of any programing environment, Swift leverages them to the next level. Swift language makes extensive use of some advance concepts in functions. (When I say functions, I am talking about functions in programming langauges in general)

        As the programming evolved over the last decaded a lot of advance concepts around functions were developed (such as functions being first class citizen, closures, lambda).

        Swift language makes extensive use of advance concepts in functions which help provide us with pretty powerful thought tooling when it comes to writing code.

    -   We will focus on understanding functions (starting with understanding them in general (agnostic to any programming language))
