# Fundamental Parts of a Function

-   A function (in almost any language) is like a machine and consists majorly of the following four parts:

    -   Name of the function (the primary interface).

    -   Argument list along with their (data) types.

    -   Return value (data) type.

    -   The body.

-   In the list above, some items are optional (may or may not be present) and others are mandatory.

    -   Mandatory:

        -   Name (Generally speaking, except for anonymous functions which can be found in some languages).

        -   Body.

    -   Optional:

        -   Argument list (A function may take no arguments).

        -   Return value (A function may not return anything. May just have a side effect, like updating value of a global variable or printing something on console or displaying a dialogue box).

-   Most imperative programming languages with support for functions will have these four parts.

-   How the parts are presented may vary based on the syntax the language uses.

-   Now there may be certain variations to the above "core concepts" depending on the prorgamming langauge.

    -   Some languages may support returning more than one value.

    -   Some languages may support anonymous functions (meaning the function lacks a name).
