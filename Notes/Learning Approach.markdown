# Learning Approach

1.  Establish a crystal clear understanding of the fundamental concepts and the philosophy behind it in a simple and clear manner. Don't overcomplicate it.

2.  Practise with some simple real world examples. In your mind, every time you practice, notice the correlation between your understanding of the fundamental and what you see in the practical example.

3.  Your understanding should never get invalidated with what you observe.

4.  If you understanding is getting invalidated (you understand something, but you notice something different when looking at it in practice), go back to step #1, clear your doubts, and then again resume with practice (looking at examples).

5.  After a few iterations, you will stop noticing any inconsistencies and start feeling confident.

6.  With this newfound confidence, you'll have to urge to look at more and more examples, play around with more and more code and samples. This will lead you to a positive and productive virtuous cycle and you'll start enjoying it.

7.  When you reach this stage, you organically start getting sped up. And this is where (for that particular concept that you leaned), the tool stopped getting in the way.

8.  Since you are doing more and more of it, you are automatically getting better at it.

9.  Our aim is to hit that virtuous cycle. That's the ultimate aim to be in this phase/space.

10. Once you are at this stage, you are set. The more you enjoy, the more you do it!
