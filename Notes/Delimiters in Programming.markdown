# Delimiters in Programming

-   Delimiters are used for delimiting content. They come in various types. Below is a list with their formal and causal names. Make it a practise to use formal names as much as possible, because the documentation use formal name (while developers may use casual names):

    -   `[]`: Brackets or casually Square brackets.

    -   `()`: Parentheses.

    -   `{}`: Braces or casually curly brackets/braces.

    -   `<>`: Chevrons or casually angle brackets.

-   Among the above delimiters, different delimiters may be used for the same purpose across different languages (but the intent remains the same) For e.g. some languages use `{}` to create an array constant (such as `char name[20] = {'N', 'a', 'm', 'e', '\0'};`), while some other language may use another delimiter for the same purpose (such as `var name:Character = ['N', 'a', 'm', 'e']`).

-   A given language may use the same delimiter for a different purpose in a different context. For e.g. C uses `{}` both for creating array constant as well as for creating scope/block for a function/condition/loop.

Thus it is crucial to understand the meaning of a symbol as well the current context in which we are operating.

There are other deminiters as well, such as double quotes (containing strings), single quotes (containing characters) etc.
