# Programming Mindset Thoughts

-   Keep things (and thoughts) simple and design clean.

-   Don't unnecessarily complicate things.

-   Establish a solid understanding of fundamentals and reason from first principles.

-   Computer design and programming constitute layers upon layers of encapsulation and abstract ideas.

-   Only get into learning till deeper layers of encapsulation that's required for performing the task at hand. Assume that the lower layer works fine as per the defined interface contract.

-   Programming consists mostly of thinking and designing. It's akin to creative art forms such as painting and making music. Writing code (which itself is an art form in its own right), is more about manifesting our ideas.

-   The programming tools (languages, frameworks etc.) should never get in the way. Mastery over the tools lets a developer focus solely on getting their ideas translated into real software. Getting good with the tooling is a very good idea.

-   It is not a massive finished program that teaches programming, but an exposition of the thought process that developed that program. To become a good programmer, it is important to master the art of thought process, more than anything else.

-   It always helps and is recommended to have clarity of thought when programming.

-   A piece of is an evolution of thought processess. It stats tiny but goes through a lot of changes and increments. Thus it is very difficult to gauge the thought process that led to the final output of the code.

-   Don't use magic numbers. Make them explicit and clear. Or use devices such as symbolic constants or supporting variables. Magic numbers may be hard to spot (differentiate from other occurances of the same number which are not magic number or a different magic number with the same face value).

-   Be very precise and concise in the choice of words (talking about technical writing, not just code. You will be a much programmer).

-   Whenever in doubt, be explicity about usage of an operator. The compiler will compile the code anyways (as long as it is syntactically correct) and the computer will run the code anyways (as long as it is logically correct). But we strive to make it easy to read for others and (our own future self).
