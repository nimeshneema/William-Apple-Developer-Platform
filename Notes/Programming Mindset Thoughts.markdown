# Programming Mindset Thoughts

-   Keep things simple and design clean.

-   Don't unnecessarily complicate things.

-   Establish a solid understanding of fundamentals and reason from first principles.

-   Computer design and programming constitute layers upon layers of encapsulation and abstract ideas.

-   Only get into learning till deeper layers of encapsulation that's required for performing the task at hand. Assume that the lower layer works fine as per the defined interface contract.

-   Programming consists mostly of thinking and designing. It's akin to creative art forms such as painting and making music. Writing code (which itself is an art form in its own right), is more about manifesting our ideas.

-   The programming tools (languages, frameworks etc.) should never get in the way. Mastery over the tools lets a developer focus solely on getting their ideas translated into real software. Getting good with the tooling is a very good idea.
