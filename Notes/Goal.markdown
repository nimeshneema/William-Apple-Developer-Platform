# Goal

-   To become competent and confident in understanding Apple developer tooling (languages, frameworks and technologies) such that we can express and develop our ideas easily and seamlessly in the form of apps/software. This will include becoming competent in Swift, SwiftUI, Cocoa framework and other crucial tooling and technology, both 1st party and 3rd party.

-   To learn and become confident in being able to write robust, scalable, performant and stable code for Apple platform devices. This will involve establishing a deeper understanding of the design principles and patterns behind the underlying tooling and developing the right mindset and point of view. We start by understanding the design principles and the motivation that led to their design which will help us develop the correct mindset. Coupled with writing a lot of real-world code and practice will help us become both a competent and confident developer.

By taking this approach, the ultimate aim is to get the tools out of the way, so that it enables us to express our ideas in the form of apps seamlessly.

Learn and being able to write Swifty code.
